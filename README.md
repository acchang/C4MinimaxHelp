# C4MinimaxHelp

April 13
Finished.
This code was done with a little help from reddit:
https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/swpvq8/the_minimax_js_algorithm_i_wrote_for_a_connect/
https://archive.ph/e7GXm

addressed this issue:
"re: function evaluateBoardPosition(board) -- Yeah, I didn't fill out this function but presumably this function should actually do some real work."

also this: 
"We avoid calling getBoardState (because getBoardState is expensive and time-consuming to invoke). Previously, the code invoked getBoardState at depth=0 but then did nothing with the information. With this change, we could increase depth to 7 (and the time required would be identical to what depth=6 used to do)."

It's basically complete, now I will go back to my old code and fix that, and then maybe play with alpha-beta

It's just been 10 days. It feels a lot longer. It took awhile for me to get this all into my head, my RAM, for me to be aware of everything going on and be able to mix it up. 



April 3 - revisiting

I did not create this. I am importing advice I received from this Twitter thread:
